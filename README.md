### Introduction

These Python notebooks were developed by the GROWTH (Global Relay of Observatories Watching Transients Happen) international collaboration in astronomy for the GROWTH school series.  The notebooks were prepared for the [GROWTH online school](http://growth.caltech.edu/growth-school-2020.html) to be held on August 17-21, 2020.

Each Python notebooks is accompanied by an introductory lecture given by experts in the field of  time-domain astronomy and observational followup to astrophysical transients. Each lecture and its Python notebook form a “module”. There are a total of twelve such "modules"  that were presented at the GROWTH school in 2020. 

The modules can be run individually but some of the modules deal with content
provided in previous modules. The order of the GROWTH summer school in 2020 is:

* 1:  Python Basics
* 2:  Image Data Reduction
* 3:  UV/Optical/IR Photometry
* 4:  Observing Run Preparation
* 5:  Image Subtraction
* 6:  Lightcurve Analysis
* 7:  Spectroscopy
* 8: Data Analysis in X-ray Astronomy
* 9: Radio Astronomy and Data Analysis

### School 2020 participants

A JupyterHub environment was set up for the participants of the GROWTH school 2020. Please refer to the [JupyterHub user's guide](docs/users_giude_jupyterhub.md) that was prepared for the school.

For registered school participants, the link above contains all the information necessary to run the hands-on modules during the live sessions. For information about how to download the modules and install the software locally, please read [HERE](https://github.com/growth-astro/growth-school-2020/blob/master/docs/readme_download.md).

For the GROWTH school development team: more documentation on the JupyterHub infrastructure used for the school can be found [HERE](https://github.com/growth-astro/growth-school-2020/blob/master/docs/documentation.md).
